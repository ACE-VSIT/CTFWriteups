# Day11

## The Rogue Gnome

Deploy your machine and read through the provided information, then letâ€™s move on to the questions!

The first two questions can be found in the information provided and you can answer them easily.

Then we'll ***SSH*** into the box with the provided credentials:

`ssh cmnatic@10.10.55.73` 

On the first connect, you will have to confirm the servers fingerprint.

Then with `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`  we'll search for binaries that have the ***SUID bit set*** which ***means that they can be executed with the permission of a different user.***

***/bin/bash*** seems to be a very important one. So let's just go check the permissions of that:

`ls -la /bin/bash`

With what we've got as an output, it seems as if it ***can be just run as root***, so:

`bash -p`

This will ***escalate the priveledges to root***, then all that is left is to get the ***root flag***:

`cat /root/flag.txt`

And we're done for the day!
