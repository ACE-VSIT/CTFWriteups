## The Grinch Really Did Steal Christmas

Read through the task and download the .pcap files!

Extract them.

Open pcap1.pcap in wireshark.

For the first question, apply the filter ***icmp*** and ***go through the first entry*** in order to find the IP address that initiates an ICMP/ping.

The next question can be answered if you've read the given information in the task carefully! 
However, the answer would be, `http.request.method == GET`

In the next question, it is clearly written to use the above filter in Wireshark, so we'll be doing as per what is told along with ip.src==10.10.67.199: `ip.addr == 10.10.67.199 && <answer_from_previous_question>` to find the article name.

For the next question, use the filter `ftp` and follow the one saying ***please specify the password and got the above password*** by right click and then select follow!

For the next question, the name of protocol that has been encrypted is `ssh`.

Now, letâ€™s ***open pcap3.pcap*** for the final question. 

Then go to File > Export Objects > HTTP.

Select the file and save it. 

Then extract the wishlist and you'll get the following files:

Try opening all the files only to explore things but you'll get the flag in ***elf_mcskidy_wishlist.txt***
